                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Undoubtedly among the best reasons to visit Maldives will be the laid-back time on the beaches without any trace of littering, but the vast bluish green Indian Ocean kissing the horizon. While mornings with soft sunlight and calmer waves are blissful, the twilight hours with thousand hues of red, orange and purple are magical. Enjoy the sea breeze and the sound of the waves in constant 25-30-degree centigrade temperature. Redefine romance under the gazillion stars.</p>
                <p>Far stretched white sandy beaches flanking the turquoise blue Indian Ocean, stilted waterside villas, a romantic candlelit dinner with a glass of champagne at the gazebo on water – Maldives is all about luxury and tryst with nature. Often called as the Manhattan of the Indian Ocean, the metropolis charm of the Hulhule Island is blended perfectly with the tropical charm and that is one of the prevalent reasons to visit Maldives.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Though traveling to Thailand is commonplace for Europeans, most North Americans consider it too far away and even too exotic to visit on a regular week or two-week vacation. That’s a shame​ because if you can get past the 14-plus hours on a plane, Thailand is a mind-expanding vacation destination. Although it’s always better to visit if you have weeks or even a month to spare, you’ll also get plenty out of your visit if you go for just a week or 10 days.
            The dollar goes a long way in Thailand. There are hundreds of hotels and guesthouses available for prices that sound like America in the mid-20th century. Thai food is likewise inexpensive, and often the street food vendors, who typically sell dishes for what Americans consider pocket change, offer the most delicious stuff. Want to splurge? That's even better because Thailand has some outstanding hotels and resorts, all for significantly less than you would pay back home.</p>
